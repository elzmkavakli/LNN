I. INTRODUCTION

Liquid Neural Networks (LNNs) are an emerging modeling technique in artificial intelligence and machine learning, gaining increasing importance. While current neural networks are typically built on fixed and static structures, LNNs offer dynamic connectivity patterns and adaptive learning capabilities . These features make LNNs particularly effective for tasks involving complex and variable data structures, such as time series forecasting.

LNNs are inspired by the functioning of biological neurons, specifically modeled after the 302 neurons in the nervous system of the microscopic roundworm C. elegans. LNNs are designed with fewer but more complex nodes [1]. The "liquid" component of LNNs enhances dynamic learning abilities through the use of Liquid Time Constants (LTCs). LTCs provide the capability to adapt to new inputs and form the core of LNN’s adaptive nature. This design helps protect against issues like gradient explosion that can affect traditional RNNs, thus supporting more stable network performance .

Among the advantages of LNNs are their adaptive learning capacities and compact, high-information-density structures. For instance, Hasani demonstrated in a TED talk that a vehicle could be guided using just 19 nodes, illustrating that LNNs are more transparent and analyzable compared to traditional neural networks .

The aim of this study is to thoroughly examine the advantages of LNNs and explore how this technology can be applied in tasks such as time series forecasting. Additionally, highlighting the differences and superiorities of LNNs compared to traditional neural networks is a key objective of this research.

II. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LNNs AND TRADITIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS

Traditional neural networks generally operate through fixed weights and static connections between neurons. These networks utilize nonlinear activation functions such as ReLU, sigmoid, or tanh to transform inputs into nonlinear outputs, allowing the network to model complex relationships within the data .

In contrast, LNNs stand out due to their dynamic and adaptive structures. LNNs typically process data through linear transformations, continuously learning and updating based on these transformations. This feature makes LNNs more suitable for handling time series data. However, they might not be as effective as traditional neural networks when dealing with static or fixed data .

Another advantage of LNNs is that they generally require fewer neurons and less computational power. Their ability to handle variable-length inputs allows them to adjust the number of neurons and connections accordingly. This feature enhances the LNN’s capacity to understand tasks and process data, thereby increasing model efficiency .
